Day1 of github training
Today we learnt about git clone,git status,git add filename,git commit -m,git restore --staged "filename" and git pull
1.To create keys->ssh-keygen -t rsa on the local system 
You will have .ssh dir where the public and private keys are stored
2.Open the public key file and copy it 
3.In the github open->settings->ssh and GPG keys
Add new ssh->paste the public key and give a title.For the pulbic key move the cursor to the content only.
And the key is given from local to remote.local means laptop and remote means github
4.Git has the capacity to match the private key
5.w.r.t github downloading means clone
6.open the repo you want and go to code dropbox you will get https and ssh links
7.use git clone to download the repo to your local
8.git clone (https link or ssh)
9.https will ask for creds whereas ssh will clone to the local system.
10.git clone (link) your custom file name  (optional)
11.let's say you added one more file to the repo locally
git add .
This will add all the files to the remote
see git status -->green color
12.git commit -m "Your message"
13.git push this will push the locally added files to the remote
14.I dont want to push one private file.Use 
gid restore --staged "filename" -->Do this step after add before commit only.After push this step is of no use
15.Someone made some changes to the remote file I want those locally.I can use,
git pull
I can see all the changes locally.
16.But if u make changes locally you have to again add,commit and push the file to git.
