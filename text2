Day2 of training:

To go to deleted or before modified part/to show the commit history:

On the remote press commit
On the local-> git log or git log --oneline or git log --oneline -5 

To remove commit 1 step back:
git reset     (soft,hard,mixed)
git reset --soft HEAD~1  (1=count of commit,It will go one commit back.)

To revert the commit back 
git pull --force or git pull 

If you make changes locally and want to retrieve the data from remote we must use,
git stash and git pull --force

Git Branch:
git branch ->*main

To create a branch:
git checkout -b hasitha (this creates a branch called hasitha)

To make it the working branch:
git checkout hasitha (This will make the working branch)

git push origin hasitha 
git push --set-upstream origin hasitha ------>>>> This is used to push branch files to main pull requests

In the remote you can find a pull request from the hasitha branch
Merge the 2 branches.This is used to merge the files of main with hasitha and hasitha with main.It only works at that point.


How to merge 2 repos?

Create 2 repos remotely.With same file names and some content on both repos
1.Internal
2.External

Clone the internal repo locally.Remotely add the external repo to your internal repo.

cmd-->git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Renuka-Hasitha/locally_creted.git

This adds the repo remotely.Now run,

git fetch --all -->this will fetch all the related meta data
git cherry-pick (copy sha add from commits of internal) 

Now the contents of external get over written by the internal repo.
eg:both repos have abc.py file
now,in the internal repo we have->print("Hello")
in the external we have-->print("Hello");print("World")

So when we fetch all and do cherry pick we get
print("Hello");print("World")
